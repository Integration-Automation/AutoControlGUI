"""Release helper for the dev channel, ``je_auto_control_dev`` on PyPI.

The ``publish-dev`` job of ``.github/workflows/dev.yml`` runs it once the tests pass:

* ``python scripts/dev_release.py prepare`` writes ``pyproject.toml`` from ``dev.toml`` with the
  next version: one patch above the newest ``X.Y.Z`` release on PyPI, or above the version in
  ``dev.toml`` when that is higher. Nothing is committed back, so the version in ``dev.toml`` is a
  floor, raised by hand only when PyPI refuses a number (a deleted release keeps its number).
* ``python scripts/dev_release.py changed dist`` compares the wheel in ``dist`` with the newest
  published one and writes ``changed=true`` or ``changed=false`` to ``$GITHUB_OUTPUT``, so a push
  that ships nothing new publishes nothing.

``prepare`` replaces the checkout's ``pyproject.toml``, tool configuration included, so it is for
a throwaway checkout (the CI job, a scratch worktree), never a working tree.
