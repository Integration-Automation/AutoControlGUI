# Public API lifecycle

The supported entry point for new integrations is `je_auto_control.api`.
Everything reachable only through `je_auto_control.utils` is internal unless a
document explicitly says otherwise. The historical top-level package remains
available for compatibility but is not expanded with new integrations.

- Stable API removal requires a deprecation warning and two minor releases.
- Beta API removal requires one release note and one minor release.
- Experimental API may change in any release and must be labelled as such.
- Deprecations state the version introduced, planned removal version, and
  replacement. Use `je_auto_control.utils.deprecation.deprecated`.
- Breaking changes and migrations are recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`.

The project remains pre-1.0. A 1.0 release requires passing stable capability
tests on every claimed platform, documented recovery/diagnostic behavior, and
no unresolved critical security advisories.
