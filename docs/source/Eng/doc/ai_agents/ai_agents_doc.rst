AI agents and computer use
===========================

AutoControl is an open-source, cross-platform computer-use and GUI automation framework for AI agents.

Use it when an agent needs to control a real desktop GUI rather than only a browser DOM or API.

When to use AutoControl
-----------------------

AutoControl is a good fit for:

* real mouse and keyboard input;
* screenshots and screen-coordinate interaction;
* OCR and accessibility-tree discovery;
* image/template matching;
* vision-language-model UI localization;
* anchor and self-healing locators;
* native desktop applications and real browsers;
* cross-platform desktop and mobile automation;
* deterministic JSON action files;
* MCP-based computer use.

MCP for AI agents
-----------------

Install and start the stdio MCP server:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install je_auto_control
   je_auto_control_mcp

The server exposes the canonical ac_* tools and short, model-friendly aliases for common actions:

* click
* move_mouse
* scroll
* type
* press
* hotkey
* screenshot
* screen_size
* find_image
* find_text
* click_text
* drag
* list_windows
* focus_window
* wait_image
* wait_pixel

Disable aliases when a client needs only canonical tools:

.. code-block:: bash

   JE_AUTOCONTROL_MCP_ALIASES=0 je_auto_control_mcp

Use read-only mode for inspection-only clients:

.. code-block:: bash

   je_auto_control_mcp --read-only

Recommended agent loop
----------------------

#. Observe the current screen.
#. Identify the target with accessibility, OCR, image matching, or VLM.
#. Perform the smallest required action.
#. Wait for the interface to settle.
#. Verify the expected result.
#. Retry with another locator strategy if the UI changed.

OpenAI tool selection
---------------------

OpenAI Chat Completions has a provider-side tool-count limit. Do not pass the complete AutoControl catalogue to an OpenAI agent. Export a focused allow-list:

.. code-block:: python

   from je_auto_control.utils.tool_use_schema import export_openai_tools

   tools = export_openai_tools(only=[
       "AC_screenshot",
       "AC_click_mouse",
       "AC_write",
       "AC_hotkey",
       "AC_click_text",
   ])

Focused toolsets are also safer: keep shell, process execution, package loading, and recursive agent commands out of the list unless explicitly required.

Examples
--------

For the closed-loop Python agent see the repository example at examples/05_agent_loop.py.

A stdio MCP client can launch AutoControl with:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "autocontrol": {
         "command": "je_auto_control_mcp"
       }
     }
   }

Security
--------

An AI-controlled GUI process has control over the host machine.

* Keep servers on loopback unless remote access is intentional.
* Use --read-only for inspection-only clients.
* Prefer explicit tool allow-lists.
* Do not expose shell/process/package-loading tools to untrusted models.
* Use authentication, audit, rate limiting, and confirmation controls for service deployments.

Single-command dispatch
-----------------------

``executor.execute_one(name, arguments)`` and ``run_tool_call`` share script authorization,
interpolation, cancellation and journal capture while returning raw command results.
Private executor arguments are rejected. Identity-scoped calls require command capability.

Managed tasks
-------------

Start the local task service explicitly with ``je_auto_control agent-task start``.
Python, AC, MCP, REST, CLI and the Agent Tasks view share submit/observe/act/finish,
pause/resume/cancel and owner-scoped status. Completion requires deterministic evidence;
model stop text is not proof. Skills use WorkQueue and local inference uses a configured
Ollama model without downloads, redirects or external fallback. Closing the view leaves
submitted work owned by the service. Native/platform acceptance and remaining workflows
are tracked in ``Progress.md``; full contracts are in ``docs/AGENT_TASKS.md``.

Native calls use an owned helper process tree with cancellation/deadlines, a host input ledger
and per-session exclusion across databases. Native platform acceptance remains deferred.

Use ``draft_agent_workflow`` or ``agent-task draft`` to preview download/archive, CSV/XLSX form,
cross-application transfer and workspace templates. Review the compiled scope, per-step read-back
checks and completion conditions before submission. The Agent Tasks Actions menu exposes preview.

Windows shared-desktop tasks require unlocked inactivity for sixty seconds. Physical input requests
pause through an independent helper notice. ``stop_all_agent_tasks`` or ``agent-task stop-all`` cancels
visible tasks. Other shared desktops need an activity adapter. Monotonic budget history survives restart.

Use ``get_agent_task_receipts`` for per-row results and ``reconcile_agent_task`` to record an explicit
owner witness for an uncertain effect before resume. Task metadata links history, journal and reports.
Generated cache expires after thirty days; user outputs and external journals are preserved. Images
are ephemeral unless strict-redacted persistence is explicitly enabled.

``manage_agent_trigger`` captures approved interval/cron/file/event templates and refreshes the owner
on each fire. Event/task deduplication commits atomically. ``submit_agent_task`` accepts an optional
idempotency key; CLI and Actions expose trigger controls. Managed scopes reject ambient vault resolution.

Input ownership writes a private, fsynced per-resource crash witness before native dispatch and input ACK. An unfinished witness blocks new owners across databases. Explicit host-only recovery requires a review note and a trusted no-held-input probe, never replays persisted input or signals persisted PIDs, and does not reconcile/resume the old task. POSIX input helpers monitor their actual parent and retire only their own live session group. Approved document handoff runs outside the input helper tree, so user applications survive normal task cleanup; bounded, preapproved focus steps wait for scoped windows. Observations also expire against a host monotonic clock. Native desktop/device acceptance remains unverified.

Managed skill candidates store sealed task scopes, typed explicit data slots and source-task provenance in the runtime SQLite database. Recording requires confirmed receipts and independently verified success. Validation creates a distinct pinned task; publication requires that exact trial's successful completion, an explicit review note and a compare-and-set version. Semantic selector repairs create new candidates. In-flight tasks retain their original version/digest; arbitrary pointer receipts are not guessed into semantic skills. Legacy mutable SkillLibrary behavior is preserved.

Accepted tasks, trigger templates and skill trials retain live origin policy references. A private witness contains only current root ceilings; missing/revoked/corrupt witnesses fail closed. Authenticated local HTTP forwards the current caller's additional restrictive ceiling without granting identity or capability. Every operation checkpoint and lease maintenance rechecks roots. MCP client roots and asynchronous roots refresh are session-local; stale replies cannot renew retired authorities. Static host policies persist until replacement, while retiring client-supplied root authority revokes its references. HTTP client roots do not overwrite the shared resource provider's configured workspace. Workers/maintenance run in fresh contexts, shutdown tracks actual in-flight deliveries before lease acquisition, and unstarted queued work remains durable.

Legacy MCP wrappers and parallel/local DAG workers retain the intersection of source ceilings. Pure tool-context binding stays inert; task-aware dispatch resolves the metadata lazily.

Managed action references resolve observation-local element centers or rendered image pixels into native coordinates only after identity/freshness/fingerprint checks. Explicit coordinates cannot conflict with a reference; invalid/disabled/out-of-frame targets fail before preparing an action. SQLite atomically links grounding metadata to each prepared receipt, including requested arguments, frame ID/hash and non-image geometry; reports expose the same provenance. Local-model schemas carry an observed_target extension while legacy executor signatures stay unchanged. AgentObservationStale round-trips over local HTTP, and bounded pre-dispatch replanning requires an adapter's explicit can_reobserve guarantee. Native adapters deny it while any owned input or unsettled operation remains. Native acceptance stays unverified.

Native helper bootstrap is a bounded read-only fifteen-second handshake; actual native operations retain their configured action deadline. Rendered image geometry must match the validated JPEG dimensions.

Managed mouse presses normalize button ownership and confirm the actual cursor before input. Windows pointer checks reject foreign overlays. Vision renders the exact scoped window into cleared private GDI storage, rejects geometry changes and releases resources even on rendering/read failure. There is no desktop-crop fallback. Fake-native tests cover these paths; native acceptance remains unverified.

The Agent tasks view groups task scope, workflow settings, triggers, skills and recovery into separate pages. Its observation page lists read-only elements and shows a validated, strictly masked JPEG at one rendered pixel per logical widget pixel. Selecting a row or image point only edits a frame-bound action request; ``Actions → Perform observed action`` sends it through the shared task API. Switching tasks clears the preview, and late replies cannot replace the selected task. A new frame requires reselection before an old reference can be sent. Closing the view only detaches its requests.

Managed workflow waits (workflow_wait / AC_workflow_wait) poll only exact scoped control values or states, with cancellation and a deadline capped by the action budget (default five seconds, maximum sixty). They never replay a write or submit. Fixed skills require all previous receipts to match the pinned sequence before continuing, including after resume; autonomous model loops retain stuck detection. New form/transfer drafts refuse an already-matching confirmation before submit and wait for a fresh transition afterward. Batch configurations may provide new_record_selector to reset each record; confirmations prove the configured UI transition, and transaction-specific receipt values should be used when available. Archive drafts also re-read the exact reviewed manifest and current file digests at finish (one-megabyte manifest and sixty-four-megabyte total evidence limit).

AgentHumanReview identifies an unsaved-content or unknown-dialog gate. It persists waiting_user and retires input ownership, including for external observe requests; explicit resume still rechecks the gate. Windows detection uses native dialog/disabled-owner evidence and known English/Chinese/Japanese unsaved labels. Workspace tasks also pause for leading/trailing asterisks in document titles; a window entry may supply unsaved_selector and unsaved_value for an application-specific indicator before layout changes. These checks do not infer every application's dirty state. Recognized standard file pickers use a context-local driver on the existing AC_handle_file_dialog executor: exact unique title, same PID, confirmed foreground and canonical rooted absolute paths. UIA control patterns must belong to the actual owned root window, even when another window shares its PID. All behavior has fake-native/loopback coverage; actual platform acceptance remains unverified.

Host-reviewed targets use AgentTargetProfile and manage_agent_target (AC_agent_target; register/get/disable/enable). Names and configuration are immutable; desktop/file adapters are currently supported, and unimplemented kinds or executable settings are rejected. Tasks pin the host profile digest and cannot expand its tools, applications, roots or network origins. Availability persists across restart and is checked at dispatch; disabling requests pause/cleanup, while enabling requires explicit task resume. list_agent_targets / AC_agent_target_list / CLI agent-task targets expose passive metadata with readiness=not_probed and native_evidence=not_recorded. Full configuration requires manage_hosts; CLI agent-task target and the GUI Host targets page use the same service. Live anonymous MCP tool sessions have operator authority across direct and legacy wrapper calls; MCP host management requires an authenticated administrator. Trusted direct Python callers remain unchanged. Browser automation belongs to WebRunner (je_web_runner), with D:/Codes/WebRunner as the development source; the managed browser adapter is not part of these target registrations.

Existing browser automation, including open_path(URL) and AC_open_path, delegates to WebRunner (Python package je_web_runner). URL plans now report backend=je_web_runner; callers inspecting the previous webbrowser descriptor should use the new value. Signatures and local-file opening stay compatible. URL execution requires the configured WebRunner project and propagates WebRunnerBridgeError when unavailable, without opening an OS browser as a fallback. The development source is D:/Codes/WebRunner. Planning and injected-opener tests remain usable without that package; browser protocol support is determined by WebRunner and its selected browser. Existing dedicated browser GUI/MCP/AC paths and recorded WR_* actions share the same bridge.


MCP tool metadata discovery
------------------------------------------------------------

MCP tool discovery is available through ``search_mcp_tools(query, limit=10)`` and
``get_mcp_tool_schema(name)``, corresponding AC/MCP commands, and Diagnostics → Actions.
Search returns bounded summaries with category and required capability; full schemas require a
single-tool lookup. Both queries refresh role authority and respect the registry's read-only filter.
MCP queries use that server's live registry, including plugin changes. CLI inspection:
``je_auto_control_mcp --search-tools document --limit 5`` or ``--tool-schema ac_mcp_tool_search``.

MCP session tool availability
------------------------------------------------------------

MCP supports opt-in session disclosure: ``je_auto_control_mcp --tool-mode progressive`` starts
with five discovery controls; ``ac_mcp_tools_enable`` / ``ac_mcp_tools_disable`` change only that session.
``--tool-mode static --tool-profile ac_screen_size,ac_list_windows`` supplies a fixed profile for clients
that do not refresh tool lists. The default ``full`` mode retains its unpaginated permitted list.
Progressive/static pages use opaque, single-use cursors bound to a snapshot and caller; changed tools,
roles, view configuration or expired cursors require restarting ``tools/list``. Enable/disable notify
the owning connection. Session closure retires outstanding metadata callbacks and clears cursors.
Use ``MCPServer.configure_tool_disclosure(...)`` for HTTP/embedded servers, or host environment
``JE_AUTOCONTROL_MCP_DISCLOSURE`` and comma-separated ``JE_AUTOCONTROL_MCP_TOOL_PROFILE``.
``plan_mcp_tool_profile(...)`` and Diagnostics Actions preview startup arguments without starting a server.
Stateless requests use a fixed, unpaginated initial profile; they do not retain session enablement.
Read-only ceilings cover later plugin registrations. Unauthenticated/shared-token peers see operator
tools, matching their existing invocation ceiling; host-management tools require authenticated authority.

MCP handoff and metadata measurements
----------------------------------------------------------------------

MCP asynchronous calls preserve the accepting caller's role, session, exact root policy and
disclosure view; retired sessions and path policies reject late dispatch. Stateless async calls keep
their fixed profile. HTTP tool-list changes reach all live session streams for plugin updates, while
session enable/disable targets one owner and avoids duplicate delivery. Stream registration and HTTP
headers share one lock so an early notification cannot precede the response headers.
The metadata-only ``benchmarks/mcp_discovery.py --repeats 20`` benchmark records count, JSON bytes,
warm in-process handshake, search and enable latency. The captured Windows/Python 3.14.4 run has
732 permitted tools / 358,029 initial response bytes in full mode and 5 / 2,029 in progressive mode
(99.43% fewer response bytes). Handshake is 58.263 / 47.439 ms; search median is 16.243 / 19.718 ms.
Progressive enable median is 42.486 ms. These local timings exclude cold imports and native work.
See the dated JSON report under ``docs/benchmarks/``; argument-policy coverage limits remain in ``Progress.md``.
