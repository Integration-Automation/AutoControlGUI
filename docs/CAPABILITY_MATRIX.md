# Capability matrix

Status meanings: **stable** is compatibility-supported, **beta** is suitable
for evaluation with documented limitations, and **experimental** may change
without a compatibility window.

| Capability | Status | Windows | Linux X11 | Linux Wayland | macOS |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Mouse, keyboard, screenshot | stable | CI | CI/Xvfb | partial | implementation |
| JSON executor and variables | stable | CI | CI | CI | platform-neutral |
| Image and anchor locators | beta | CI | CI | screenshot-only | implementation |
| Accessibility locator | beta | CI | backend tests | unavailable | backend tests |
| Recorder | beta | CI | implementation | unavailable | unavailable |
| Reports, trace, failure bundle | stable | CI | CI | CI | platform-neutral |
| REST, MCP, scheduler | beta | CI | CI | CI | platform-neutral |
| Remote desktop / WebRTC | beta | tests | tests | tests | tests |
| Android and iOS bridges | experimental | mocked CI | mocked CI | mocked CI | mocked CI |
| LLM/VLM agents | experimental | fake-backend CI | fake-backend CI | fake-backend CI | fake-backend CI |
| USB passthrough | experimental | hardware-unverified | backend tests | backend tests | hardware-unverified |

“Implementation” means code exists but the repository does not currently run a
real OS runner for it. It must not be interpreted as a production guarantee.
Hardware-backed results and known limitations should be attached to releases.
