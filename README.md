### AutoControl
> Project Kanban \
> https://github.com/users/JE-Chen/projects/35 \
> Image & Coordinate based GUI Testing \
> GUI automated testing based on image comparison and coordinates. \
> Cross-platform and cross-programming language.\
> Solve problems:
>> * Provide automation execution for repetitive tasks.
>> * Multiple methods are available, including recording, image recognition, and coordinate-based testing.
>> * Tests can be executed remotely through TCP/IP.
>> * Test reports can be generated with records for each action.
>> * The same code can be used for three platforms, reducing the possibility of platform-dependent programs.
>> * Provide hooks for keyboard and mouse events and state checks (including using code to simulate key presses).
>> * Can use keywords for development to improve readability.
